# CPU type is by default 68EC020, try 68000 or 68010 if EC020 doesn't work with the ROM.

# Map any size ROM to a the (max) 512KB KB system ROM default address with OVL enabled.
# The id=sysrom and id=sysram for the ROM and WTC RAM are necessary in order for the 68k Mac's OVL to function properly.

# Map X KB/MB of RAM starting at $0. The type of this RAM map is "wtcram", which is short for Write Through Cache RAM.
# It appears that the Mac Classic sound/video chips can't write to RAM, only read from it, so this should be sufficient
# unless there's something I've missed. Only uncomment one of these lines at any time, depending on how much physical RAM is installed.

#   "grab" steals the keyboard from the Pi so Amiga/etc. input is not sent to the Pi

# Select a specific filename for the keyboard event source.
# This is typically /dev/input/event1 or event0, but it may be event3 with for instance a wireless keyboard.
# Use ls /dev/input/event* to check which event files are available and try until you find the one that works.

# Forward mouse events to host system, defaults to off unless toggle key is pressed on the Pi.
# Syntax is mouse [device] [toggle key] [autoconnect|noautoconnect]
